# logan-police-blotter

Here in Logan, Utah, the city has a "blotter" feed on [their site](http://www.loganutah.org/Police/Reports/media.cfm). I thought I'd play around with sqlite and start keeping an archive of police reports since the city only allows you to view up to 3 days back. This DB might be interesting to go through in the future. The raw database can be downloaded [from here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/h5yyz15rnigbnue/logan_pd_blotter.db?dl=0) (updated twice daily).
